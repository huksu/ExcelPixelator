Excel Pixelator lets you create an Excel file that uses cell background colors to create a pixelated image.

To use, name your input file "image.png", and run the excelpixelator.py script.
The output file will be saved as "image.xlsx".

Alternatively, you can change the image name string in the code.
You can also play with the sizes of the pixels and cells to get your desired effect.

Excel Pixelator requires the PIL (The Python Image Library) and the xlsxwriter packages.

Happy hacking!
